# FOSS Image Editor

"FOSS Image Editor" is fully Open Source. And needs no unnecessary permissions (only write on storage to save the edited pictures). It's lightweight (< 5 mb), clean, easy to use and nice looking.

### Features:

- adjustments: brightness, gamma, saturation, ...
- filter: sepia, monochrome, invert, poster, comic, ...
- add text: add, resize and rote text
- crop: crop, rotate or flip the image

### Privacy:

- permissions: only "read and write on sd-card"
- dependencies: no Google dependencies
- sending user data: no user data will be collected and send to any other servers.
- "FOSS Image Editor" doesn't have permission to use the internet

To achieve this, I'm using several libraries (see in the About --> license dialog). I will only add new features, when it doesn't make to much trouble. In the best case there's a library to achieve the implementation of new features. So please test "FOSS Image Editor" and give your feedback. The Open Source Community is depending on users, who share their experience.
